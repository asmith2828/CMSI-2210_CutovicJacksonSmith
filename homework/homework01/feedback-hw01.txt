SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

Excellent that you attempted the assembly code right out of the gate!  I'm
assuming that it is for a mac with x86-type processor?  If that is the case
there are a couple of things to be aware of:

   1. the gcc compiler will likely want to see the entry point be "_main"
      rather than "start".  This is just something that the linker inside
      gcc wants.  The leading underscore is important, too.
   2. you did your research on adding newlines!  This is excellent!  You
      should be proud of what you found out and incorporated.
   3. remember when you are adding characters to your output character
      string, you will also need to change the number of characters that
      the program will be sending out.  In line 7 of your code, you still
      have the default "13" which is simply the "Hello, World" string, but
      when you add the newline characters in front of that you end up with
      15 characters.  Adding the two newlines at the end makes 17 of 'em.

As a challenge to yourselves, see if you can find a different way of reading
   values from the user.  There are several different ways of doing that, so
   do a little research to see what else is available.

Off to a great start!
