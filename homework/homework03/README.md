# Problems for Assignment #3
## Learning Objectives:
<blockquote>
  1. Understanding different number representations<br />
  2. Practice with the different common number bases used by computers<br />
  3. Practice translating values between different bases<br />
  4. Practice translating values between different representations<br />
  5. Practice/understanding of carry, overflow, saturated, and modular computer arithmetic
</blockquote>

Please do all these problems WITHOUT using a computer or calculator.

The purpose of these exercises is to help you develop your skill.

Taking the time to practice will give you a better ability and understanding of the material.

Remember that the prefix "0x" or "0X" indicates that a value is shown in hexadecimal [base 16].

          <li>If we had 20-bit registers, the smallest signed decimal integer value would be: -524,288
          <li>If we had 20-bit registers, the largest signed decimal integer value would be: 524,287

      </ol>

These problems give you more to think about with the concepts of number conversion and arithmetic.

These problems are difficult and will require you to do some research to get the answers.  <strong>They are considered optional</strong> and you will get extra credit for getting them correct, one point per problem.  For any you attempt for which the answer is <em><u>incorrect</u></em>, you will NOT be penalized, you just won't get any credit for them.
