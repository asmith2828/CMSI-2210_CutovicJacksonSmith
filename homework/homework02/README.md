# Problems for Assignment #2
## Learning Objectives
<blockquote>
1. One main learning outcome: drilling in some of the initial concepts from the first and second weeks<br />
2. Ancillary learning outcome: terms, definitions, people, etc. instrumental to computer systems
</blockquote>

Answers to the following questions can be found in the information on the course weekly pages for weeks one and two, or you can look them up on the Internet. If you do that, please include a link to where the answer came from.  Try to answer in your own words, though, from your "head knowledge" because that will help you to really remember these rather than just regurgitating them for a grade.

## Questions
1. What is a "computer system"?
   A computer system is a set of layers within the computer. Each layer is needed for the layers above it to work.
2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
   Some of the layers are User, High-level language, Assembly language, System Software, Machine, Control and Digital Logic.
3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
   Compiled languages translate the entire file to the computer before execution while interpreted languages translate while the file runs.
4. Is "C" a compiled language? 
   Yes it is, but it is not compiled like Java, it is compiled directly.
5. Who invented the "C" language?
   Dennis Ritchie created the "C" language.
6. How long has "C" been in use?
   The "C" language was created in 1972.
7. Is a compiler a translator? 
   Yes it is.
8. Is an assembler a translator? 
   Yes, it translates from assembly language into machine language.
9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
   The command is "ls"
10. What does the "C" function atof() do? 
   It turns a character string into a floating point value.
11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
   Digital Logic: This is the actual hardware that  the computer runs on (eg. gates, circuits and chips).
   Control: The control is essentially microcode that uses the digital hardware to run.
12. What are the three "steps" of the Von Neumann Architecture?
   First the control unit retrieves the following instruction from memory, the instruction's    address is stored in the program counter. The instruction is then decoded so the microcode can comprehend what it needs to do. This can include more retrievals from main memory to gather any more instructions needed, that are then placed into registers in the CPU. Lastly, the ALU uses the decoded instructions to execute the instructions. The results of this may end up being placed back in main memory or in another register.
13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
   The ALU performs operations done on integers like bit-wise and mathematical operations.
14. What is a "register"?
   A tiny and very fast storage location that is used for immediate processing by the CPU.
15. What is one difference between "Application software" and "System software"?
   Application software is written for people, whereas system software is written for computers.
16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
   No, it is assembly language.
17. How many buses are included in the system bus?
   There are 3 buses in the system bus.
18. What is the decimal value of 10010111<sub>2</sub>?
   151
19. What is the decimal value of 11111111<sub>2</sub>?
   255
20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits? 
   2^17 - 1 or 65,535
